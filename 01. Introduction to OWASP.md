## üìò What is OWASP?

OWASP helps developers, security professionals, and organizations by offering:

- ‚úÖ Free and open-source tools  
- üìö Educational materials and best practices  
- üìã Security standards and checklists  
- üë• Community-led projects and global collaboration  

The most popular OWASP resource is the **OWASP Top 10**, which lists the most critical web application security risks.

## üîü OWASP Top 10 ‚Äì 2021 

This version reflects modern threats like insecure design, supply chain issues, and internal request abuse.

1. **Broken Access Control**  
   Users can perform actions they‚Äôre not authorized for.  
   **Example:** Regular users accessing admin pages by changing a URL.  
   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data leaks, full account takeover.

2. **Cryptographic Failures**  
   Weak or missing encryption for sensitive data.  
   **Example:** Plaintext passwords, no HTTPS.  
   **Impact:** Data theft, privacy violations.

3. **Injection**  
   Untrusted data is treated as a command.  
   **Example:** SQL Injection.  
   **Impact:** Data manipulation, server access.

4. **Insecure Design**  
   Security is not considered during planning.  
   **Example:** No rate-limiting, poor validation.  
   **Impact:** Hard-to-fix long-term security flaws.

5. **Security Misconfiguration**  
   Systems aren‚Äôt set up securely.  
   **Example:** Default passwords, open ports.  
   **Impact:** Easy entry point for attackers.

6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**  
   Using unsafe libraries or plugins.  
   **Example:** Outdated JavaScript libraries.  
   **Impact:** Known exploits used by attackers.

7. **Identification & Authentication Failures**  
   Broken login systems.  
   **Example:** Weak session IDs, no MFA.  
   **Impact:** User impersonation, unauthorized access.

8. **Software & Data Integrity Failures**  
   Trusting unverified software/code.  
   **Example:** Insecure CI/CD dependencies.  
   **Impact:** Code injection, malware distribution.

9. **Security Logging & Monitoring Failures**  
   No alerts or records of suspicious activity.  
   **Example:** No logging for failed logins.  
   **Impact:** Attacks go unnoticed.

10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**  
    Server is tricked into sending internal requests.  
    **Example:** Malicious URL triggers internal service access.  
    **Impact:** Internal data leakage, server scanning.

## üîü OWASP Top 10 ‚Äì 2017 

Focused on code vulnerabilities and basic misconfigurations.

1. **Injection**  
   Input is interpreted as code.  
   **Example:** SQL, OS command injection.  
   **Risk:** Full data or system compromise.

2. **Broken Authentication**  
   Weakness in login/session handling.  
   **Example:** Predictable session tokens.  
   **Risk:** Unauthorized account access.

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**  
   Data isn‚Äôt securely stored or transmitted.  
   **Example:** No encryption.  
   **Risk:** Identity theft, legal issues.

4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**  
   XML input exposes internal files.  
   **Example:** Malicious XML payloads.  
   **Risk:** File disclosure, SSRF.

5. **Broken Access Control**  
   Restrictions are bypassed.  
   **Example:** Accessing unauthorized user profiles.  
   **Risk:** Data tampering, privilege escalation.

6. **Security Misconfiguration**  
   Unsafe default settings.  
   **Example:** Debug mode enabled in production.  
   **Risk:** Information leakage, attack surface expansion.

7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
   Scripts injected into web pages.  
   **Example:** Stealing cookies via comment fields.  
   **Risk:** Session hijacking, fake UI injection.

8. **Insecure Deserialization**  
   Unsafe object creation from user input.  
   **Example:** PHP/Java object deserialization.  
   **Risk:** Remote code execution.

9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**  
   Vulnerable 3rd-party libraries.  
   **Example:** Old versions of jQuery, Struts.  
   **Risk:** Known bugs are exploited.

10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**  
    Attacks are not recorded or noticed.  
    **Example:** No alerts on suspicious activity.  
    **Risk:** Delayed incident response.

## üîü OWASP Top 10 ‚Äì 2013 

Covered common flaws seen in early 2010s apps.

1. **Injection**  
   Malicious input runs commands.  
   **Impact:** Data theft, server control.

2. **Broken Auth & Session Management**  
   Weak login/session handling.  
   **Impact:** Account hijacking.

3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
   Attacker scripts run in browser.  
   **Impact:** Data theft, UI tampering.

4. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**  
   Accessing objects (like IDs) without validation.  
   **Impact:** Data leakage, access violations.

5. **Security Misconfiguration**  
   Unsafe setups in code or infrastructure.  
   **Impact:** Easily exploited flaws.

6. **Sensitive Data Exposure**  
   Unprotected sensitive information.  
   **Impact:** Financial fraud, identity theft.

7. **Missing Function Level Access Control**  
   No checks for backend functions.  
   **Impact:** Unauthorized operations.

8. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**  
   Users tricked into performing actions.  
   **Impact:** Unwanted transactions or changes.

9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**  
   Unpatched 3rd-party tools.  
   **Impact:** Public exploits can be used.

10. **Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards**  
    Users are redirected to untrusted URLs.  
    **Impact:** Phishing, malware delivery.
